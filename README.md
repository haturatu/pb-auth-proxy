# Auth Proxy

This is a simple authenticating reverse proxy written in Go. It provides a flexible authentication layer that can be placed in front of any backend web service.

It handles user registration, login, and session management, and proxies authenticated requests to the configured backend. It also includes an administration dashboard for user management.

## Why I Built This

I'm also the developer of [puremania](https://github.com/haturatu/puremania), and I wanted to avoid adding complex authentication logic to that project.
While integrating authentication into every application is good for security, it's a hassle to manage separate IDs and passwords for each one. This is a common problem for self-hosting enthusiasts who need a centralized way to control access.
This project aims to solve that by acting as a central authentication service. By referencing the same database, user information can be shared across different applications.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Provides login, logout, and registration pages.
- **Reverse Proxy**: Proxies authenticated users to a backend service.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A simple UI to manage users (update roles, activate/deactivate, delete).
- **Flexible Database Support**: Works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
- **Pluggable Frontend**: Supports multiple frontend modes (JS-driven or PHP).
- **Security Hardening**:
    - **Brute-force Protection**: Locks user accounts after a configurable number of failed login attempts.
    - **User Creation Rate Limiting**: Prevents the same IP from creating too many users in a short period.
    - **Configurable Password Policies**: Enforce password strength requirements. See details below.
    - **Secure Session Cookies**: Uses `HttpOnly` secure cookies for session management.
- **Highly Configurable**: Nearly all aspects, including database connections, security policies, and internal URL paths, can be configured via an `.env` file.
- **Structured Logging**: Detailed application and security logs using `slog`.
- **CLI for Admin Creation**: A command-line tool to easily create initial admin users.

## Security and Authentication Details

### Password Encryption

User passwords are never stored in plaintext. They are securely hashed using the **bcrypt** algorithm, a strong, adaptive hashing function designed specifically for passwords. When a user logs in, the provided password is
hashed and then compared to the stored hash, preventing plaintext password exposure even if the database is compromised.

### Authentication Flow

The proxy supports two distinct authentication flows for different use cases:

#### 1. Web UI (Session-Based)

This flow is designed for users interacting with the application through a web browser.

1.  A user submits their username and password via the login page.
2.  The server validates the credentials against the database.
3.  On success, a cryptographically secure, random token is generated and stored in the database, associated with the user.
4.  This token is sent to the user's browser in a secure, `HttpOnly` cookie named `auth_token`, establishing a session.

#### 2. API (JWT-Based)

This flow is designed for programmatic clients and services.

1.  A client sends a `POST` request with the user's username and password to the `/api/auth/token` endpoint.
2.  The server validates the credentials.
3.  On success, it generates and returns two tokens:
    *   A short-lived **JWT Access Token** containing user claims (ID, role) and an expiration time. This token is signed to prevent tampering.
    *   A long-lived **Refresh Token** that is stored in the database and can be used to obtain a new access token.

### Session Management

#### Web UI Sessions

For subsequent requests from a browser, the `auth_token` cookie is automatically sent to the server. A middleware validates this token by looking it up in the database. If the token is valid and has not expired, the request is authenticated and allowed to proceed. When a user logs out, the session token is deleted from the database, effectively invalidating the session.

#### API Sessions (Stateless with JWT)

For API requests, the client must include the JWT Access Token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. A middleware on the server validates the token's signature and expiration time. This process is stateless, meaning it does not require a database lookup for every request, making it highly efficient. If the access token has expired, the client can use the refresh token to request a new access token without re-authenticating.

**Note on Authentication Precedence:** When an API endpoint is protected (i.e., `PROTECT_API=true`), the middleware first looks for an `Authorization: Bearer` header. If this header is not present, it will fall back to validating the `auth_token` session cookie. This allows users who are logged into the web UI to also authenticate to the API using their browser session, but it means that API endpoints are accessible via either a valid JWT or a valid session cookie.

### Configuration

Configuration is managed via a `.env` file in the root of the project. Create a file named `.env` and add the necessary variables.

# Example `.env` file:

```dotenv
# --- Server Settings ---
# The port for the proxy server to listen on
LISTEN_PORT=8080

# --- Required ---
# The URL of the backend service you want to protect
TARGET_URL=http://localhost:8081
# A long, random string for securing session cookies and JWTs
# For production, generate a new key using: openssl rand -base64 45
SESSION_SECRET=my-super-secret-key

# AUTH_ASSETS_PATH=/assets
```

### Frontend Selection

You can choose between two frontend modes using the `FRONTEND_TYPE` environment variable:

-   **`js` (or empty)**: This is the default mode. The server renders the basic HTML templates, and all authentication logic (rendering forms, handling user input) is expected to be managed by your frontend JavaScript code, which will interact with the Go backend's API endpoints.
-   **`php`**: To use the PHP-based views, you must have a running PHP-FPM service. This mode proxies GET requests for authentication pages to your PHP-FPM service, while POST requests (like login submissions) are handled by the Go backend.

#### PHP Frontend Setup

If you choose `FRONTEND_TYPE=php`, follow these steps:

1.  **Set Frontend Type in `.env`**:
    ```dotenv
    FRONTEND_TYPE=php
    ```

2.  **Configure PHP-FPM Connection in `.env`**:
    You need to provide the path to the PHP-FPM socket and the document root.
    -   `PHP_FPM_SOCKET`: The path to the PHP-FPM socket file (e.g., `/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock`).
    -   `PHP_DOC_ROOT`: The **absolute path** to the directory containing the PHP view files (e.g., `login.php`). This path must be accessible *by the PHP-FPM process*.

3.  **Copy PHP Files and Set Permissions**:
    The user that the PHP-FPM service runs as needs read access to the PHP template files.

    First, determine the PHP-FPM user. You can often find this in your PHP-FPM pool configuration file (e.g., `/etc/php/8.3/fpm/pool.d/www.conf`) or by checking the running processes:
    ```sh
    # Example command to find the PHP-FPM user
    ps aux | grep php-fpm
    ```
    Common users are `www-data`, `http`, or `apache`.

    Next, copy the `templates/php` directory to a location accessible by PHP-FPM (e.g., `/var/www/html/auth-proxy`) and set the correct ownership.

    ```sh
    # Example setup, assuming the user is 'http'
    sudo cp -r templates/php /var/www/html/auth-proxy/php
    sudo chown -R http:http /var/www/html/auth-proxy
    ```

    Finally, update your `.env` file with the correct paths:
    ```dotenv
    # --- PHP Frontend Settings ---
    FRONTEND_TYPE=php
    PHP_FPM_SOCKET=/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock
    PHP_DOC_ROOT=/var/www/html/auth-proxy/php
    ```

### Database Setup Examples

If you are using PostgreSQL or MySQL, you will need to create a database and a user for the proxy.

#### PostgreSQL

Run these commands in `psql`:

```sql
-- Create a dedicated database
CREATE DATABASE auth_proxy;

-- Create a dedicated user
CREATE USER auth_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_strong_password';

-- Grant privileges on the database to the user
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE auth_proxy TO auth_user;
```

Your `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file would then be:
`DATABASE_URL=postgres://auth_user:your_strong_password@localhost:5432/auth_proxy?sslmode=disable`

#### MySQL / MariaDB

Run these commands in the MySQL client:

```sql
-- Create a dedicated database
CREATE DATABASE auth_proxy CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

-- Create a dedicated user
CREATE USER 'auth_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_strong_password';

-- Grant privileges on the database to the user
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON auth_proxy.* TO 'auth_user'@'localhost';

-- Apply the changes
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Your `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file would then be:
`DATABASE_URL=mysql://auth_user:your_strong_password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/auth_proxy?parseTime=true`

## Usage

1.  **Create an Admin User**:

    Before starting the server, create your first admin user using the `admin-cli` tool. Make sure your `.env` file is configured correctly, as the CLI uses it to connect to the database.

    The `--username` and `--password` flags are required.

    *Successful command:*
    ```sh
    ./admin-cli --username <your-admin-username> --password <your-strong-password>
    ```

    *Example of missing flags:*
    ```sh
    $ ./admin-cli 
    time=2025-10-12T04:28:09.014+09:00 level=ERROR msg="Both --username and --password flags are required"
    ```

2.  **Run the Proxy Server**:

    ```sh
    ./auth-proxy-server
    ```

    The server will start on port `:8080` by default.

3.  **Access the Application**:

    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
    - You will be redirected to the login page.
    - Log in with the admin credentials you created.
    - Once authenticated, you will be seamlessly proxied to the `TARGET_URL`.
    - You can access the admin dashboard at `http://localhost:8080/admin` (or your configured path).

## Issuing API Tokens (Bearer Tokens)

In addition to session-based authentication for web browsers, the proxy can issue JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for programmatic API access. These tokens can be used as Bearer Tokens in the `Authorization` header to authenticate requests to protected backend APIs.

To obtain an access token and a refresh token, send a `POST` request to the `/api/auth/token` endpoint with the user's credentials in the JSON body.

**Example using `curl`:**

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "username": "your-username",
  "password": "your-password"
}' http://localhost:8080/api/auth/token
```

**Successful Response:**

If the credentials are valid, the server will respond with a JSON object containing an `access_token` and a `refresh_token`.

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxLCJyb2xlIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJleHAiOjE2Njc4OTg5ODl9.abcdef123456...",
  "refresh_token": "def456..."
}
```

The `access_token` is a short-lived JWT that should be sent in the `Authorization` header for API requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

The `refresh_token` is a long-lived token that can be used to obtain a new access token once the old one expires. To do this, send a `POST` request to the `/auth/refresh` endpoint.

**Note:** The token lifetimes can be configured in your `.env` file. See the configuration table for details.
